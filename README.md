# Driver Inertial GPS
## Objective
The project simulates a case of loss of network when ending a trip. The application uses last known location together with the average velocity on trip and elapsed time to compute any additional distances covered while the network was poor.
## Future endeavours
Accounting for road traffic delays to reduce error in approximate distance estimated.
